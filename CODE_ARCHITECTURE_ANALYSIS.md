| Controllers | 200-500 lines | Business logic and state management |
| Services | 100-300 lines | Specific functionality, external API calls |
| Repositories | 150-400 lines | Data layer management and caching |
| View Screens | 300-800 lines | UI composition and event handling |
| Widgets | 100-300 lines | Reusable UI components |
| Utilities | 50-150 lines | Helper functions and utilities |

## Refactoring Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Issues (Week 1-2)
- Refactor friend_management_screen.dart
- Refactor feed_home.dart
- Establish widget separation patterns

### Phase 2: Major Improvements (Week 3-4)
- Split audio_controller.dart
- Refactor audio_recorder_widget.dart
- Optimize photo_detail_screen.dart

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 5-6)
- Review camera_service.dart
- Optimize remaining large files
- Establish coding standards

## Code Quality Metrics

### Current Status
- **Files exceeding guidelines:** 8 out of 62 (13%)
- **Critical files:** 4 (7%)
- **Average file size:** 381 lines
- **Largest file:** 1,410 lines (353% over limit)

### Target Metrics
- **Files exceeding guidelines:** < 5%
- **Critical files:** 0%
- **Average file size:** < 300 lines
- **Maximum file size:** < 800 lines

## Implementation Guidelines

### When to Split Files

1. **File Size Triggers**
   - Models: > 200 lines
   - Controllers: > 500 lines
   - Services: > 300 lines
   - Views: > 800 lines
   - Widgets: > 300 lines

2. **Complexity Triggers**
   - Single class with multiple responsibilities
   - Methods exceeding 50 lines
   - Nested conditionals > 3 levels deep
   - Code duplication > 3 instances

3. **Maintenance Triggers**
   - Multiple developers working on same file
   - Frequent merge conflicts
   - Testing becomes difficult

### Refactoring Best Practices

1. **Maintain Single Responsibility**
   - Each file should have one clear purpose
   - Related functionality should be grouped together

2. **Preserve Existing APIs**
   - Maintain public interfaces during refactoring
   - Use gradual migration strategies

3. **Ensure Test Coverage**
   - Write tests before refactoring
   - Maintain test coverage during splits

4. **Document Changes**
   - Update architecture documentation
   - Maintain clear commit messages

## Conclusion

The codebase shows good overall structure with most components within acceptable size ranges. However, the Views layer requires immediate attention, with 4 files significantly exceeding recommended sizes. Implementing the suggested refactoring plan will improve maintainability, reduce complexity, and enable better team collaboration.

The repository layer demonstrates excellent organization and should serve as a model for other layers. The controllers and services layers are generally well-structured with only minor adjustments needed.

## Next Steps

1. Begin immediate refactoring of critical Priority 1 files
2. Establish team coding standards based on this analysis
3. Implement automated size monitoring in CI/CD pipeline
4. Schedule monthly architecture reviews to prevent regression
